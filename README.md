# DSA
A collection of solutions to common Data Structures and Algorithms problems

# Java Note:
- To run few of the Java programs, run the Test Case classes first(only once). And then the actual programs.
- TestCaseArray.java is a test case for all the array problems.
- TestCaseMatrix.java is a test case for all the matrix problems.
